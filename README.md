## Points to be noted

* Make sure HSQL DB server is running before running the test case. (Download HSQL DB from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/files/ )
* Run individual test cases inside /HibernateSample/src/test/java/com/home/hibernate/test/HibernateTest.java as *JUnit test*.  
* TestCase name is self explanatory  
* Modify the hibernate.cfg.xml file as per your DB details  
* After running the test case, check the console output to understand the flow  
* Comment non related annotations (refer the entity class annotations and the test case)
* Uncomment the required annotations(refer the entity class annotations and the test case)

*Note: This project needs to be refactored to use best practices which will be done later. As of now this code should be used only for understanding purposes.*




* *Note: Run individual test cases instead of running all the test cases together to understand better. Comment non related annotations and uncomment required annotations by refering the test case and entity class so that you will not get confused.*
